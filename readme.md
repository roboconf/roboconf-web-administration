A web application to interact with Roboconf's Deployment Manager.  
User documentation can be found on Roboconf's web site.

## Developer Guide

General guidelines about Roboconf's development are described on the web site.  
This read-me only lists specific items for the web console and Javascript development.

You need [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.  
The primary thing to do is to execute...

```
sudo npm install
npm install
```

Like Maven, this will download the required Javascript libraries.  
We then use another tool called [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to manage build actions. You should not have to install it,
it was downloaded by **npm**.


## Quick Start

Once NPM and the project's dependencies have been installed, open a command line interface
in the project, type in **gulp watch-dev** and open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
in your web browser.


## Custom Server URL

The web administration invokes the DM's REST API.  
With released versions of Roboconf, the location of the REST API is deduced from the
server. However, in development mode, it often happens that we have the DM running on one side
(available at [http://localhost:8181/roboconf-dm](http://localhost:8181/roboconf-dm)) and the
web administration running from another location ([http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)).

To be able to use a real DM in development mode, follow this procedure.

1. In the project, create the **target/dev.config** directory.
2. Create a JS file in it, e.g. **roboconf.dev.configuration.js**.
3. Copy the following content in this file.

```javascript
'use strict';

angular.module('roboconf.preferences')
.constant('ROBOCONF_SERVER_URL', 'http://localhost:8181/roboconf-dm');
```

4. Update, if necessary, the server URL.

> Notice that this file will be used for the Gulp **dev** and **dist** tasks.  
> However, an error will be thrown with the **embed** task if this directory exists.  
> This file is only here for development, not for building.

5. Since Roboconf 0.8, you will also have to enable CORS on the DM's side.  
Just edit the **etc/net.roboconf.dm.rest.services.configuration.cfg** file.


## Gulp Tasks

This section lists the Gulp tasks you can use.  
To use them, simply type them in your shell. Use...

**Checks**

* **gulp lint** to verify quality rules in the JS scripts.
* **gulp test** to run unit tests with Mocha (coverage report under **target/coverage**).
* **gulp check_i18n** verifies the internationalization.

**Development**

* **gulp watch-dev** to develop and test the application locally (http://localhost:8000).
* **gulp watch-dist** to test the distribution locally (http://localhost:8000).
* **gulp clean-dev** to delete the generated content in the **dev** directory (it preserves Bower dependencies).
* **gulp clean-dist** to delete the **dist** directory.
* **gulp clean** combines **gulp clean-dist** and **gulp clean-dev**.

**Distributions**

* **gulp dist** to create the final distribution (minimal dependencies, minification, etc).
* **gulp embed** to create a minimal distribution, without running tests or quality checks.

Other tasks do not aim at being invoked manually.

About the way these tasks were implemented, they were done this way because most of
the Roboconf team is familiar with Maven and Java development but not with Javascript.
So, to work similarly to Maven, we created a **target** directory (ignored by Git).
Here is how it is organized.

* **target/dependencies**: the Bower dependencies (or dependencies for the front-end).
* **target/dev**: the development directory, with non-minified files but with a clear structure.
* **target/dist**: the distribution directory, with minified files and another structure.
* **target/coverage**: the directory with coverage reports after the unit tests were run.
* **target/dev.config**: optional directory to create by hand and to store custom settings for development.

> **target/dist** is the thing to embed in Roboconf distributions.


## Files Description

The following files are used at some moment during development or build phases.

* **gulpfile.js**: the file that controls the build tasks.
* **package.json**: the NPM configuration (package identification and DEV dependencies management).
* **bower.json**: the Bower configuration (package identification and **Front-End** dependencies management).
* **.bowerrc**: additional configuration for Bower.
* **.jshintrc**: configuration for JS Hint (code quality).
* **karma.conf.js**: the configuration for Karma, the tool that runs tests.
* **.gitignore**: the usual file to list the files Git should not manage.
* **node_modules**: the Javascript modules used for the build, tests and server tasks (no front-end).
* **src**: the sources directory of our application.
* **tests**: the tests directory for our application.
* **.travis.yml**: the file that configures the build on Travis CI.

The following files are mainly for documentation.

* **readme.md**: the main documentation for this project.
* **NOTICE**: copyright mentions. 
* **LICENSE-2.0.txt**: the terms of the Apache license v2.


## Testing Policy

This web applications comes with tests.  
Unit tests run with [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/). Mainly services are tested unitly.  

To run unit tests, either use...

	gulp unit-tests

... or use...

	karma start --single-run

Gulp is the build tool.  
It runs Karma to run tests during the build chain. So, you can use both of them.


## Code organization

Under **src**, the code is organized in functional modules.  
Such a module contains all the JS scripts and HTML templates for a given feature (applications templates,
preferences, etc).

Under **target/dev**, we group things according to their type.  
All the JS files go under **js**. All the HTML templates go under **templates**. Notice that Gulp injects
all the JS and CSS scripts automatically in the index.html file.

Under **target/dist**, we group things differently.  
Bower dependencies are filtered and copied under **lib**. All the application's JS scripts
are merged into **roboconf.min.js**. And the CSS as well as the index files are minified too.
